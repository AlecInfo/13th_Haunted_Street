As a Hunter, you have to catch all the ghost in the haunted house to win.

You have two tools to help you do that: 
- A flashlight, to help you look for the ghosts
- A Vacuum, so you can catch them

As a Ghost, you have to hide from the hunter until the end of the round.

To help you do that, as a ghost you can transform into furniture
